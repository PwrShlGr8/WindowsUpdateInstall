# WindowsUpdateInstall
My implementation of a windows update module for installing windows updates on remote systems.

I put a strong emphasis on simplicity, reporting, and backwards compatibility.

The module works with old Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2 machines with only PowerShell 2.0 installed all the way up to modern Windows 10 / Server 2019 systems with PowerShell 5.1.

To try it out, simply download the **WindowsUpdateInstall** folder and its contents to your local disk and import it into PowerShell using **Import-Module -Path 'C:\WindowsUpdateInstall'**.
