# WindowsUpdateInstall
My implementation of a windows update module.

I put a strong emphasis on simplicity, reporting, and backwards compatibility.

The module works with old Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2 machines with only PowerShell 2.0 installed all the way up to modern Windows 10 / Server 2019 systems with PowerShell 5.1.
